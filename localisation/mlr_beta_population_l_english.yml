 mlr_beta_population_horde_population_desc:0 "BETA slowly gather in hordes of up to 200k. When they reach this size, BETA hordes will launch an aggressive invasion. The current estimated strength of this Hive is [?mlr_beta_population_horde_size|O2]k. Last month, this decreased by [?mlr_beta_population_losses_last_month|+2]k from casualties inflicted. The predicted growth is [?mlr_beta_population_horde_growth_rate|-0]k over the next §W30§! days.\n----\n§WThis value will not change while an offensive is happening. The growth can be prevented by inflicting casualties or launching a culling operation. However if the horde strength becomes too low, the BETA will replenish their strength from their inner hive reserves. We do not have an estimate on their reserve size.§!"
