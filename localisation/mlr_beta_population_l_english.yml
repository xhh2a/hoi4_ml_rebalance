 mlr_beta_population_horde_population_desc:0 "BETA slowly gather in hordes of up to 200k. When they reach this size, BETA hordes will launch an aggressive invasion. The current estimated strength of this Hive is [?mlr_beta_population_horde_size|-2]k. Last month, this decreased by [?mlr_beta_population_losses_last_month|+2]k from casualties inflicted. [?mlr_beta_population_reserve_last_month|-2]k additional BETA emerged from the underground reserves. The predicted change is [?mlr_beta_population_horde_growth_rate|-0]k over the next §W30§! days.\n----\n§WDuring an offensive, a -50k growth modifier applies as the horde deploys. The growth can be prevented by inflicting casualties or launching a culling operation. However if the horde strength becomes too low, the BETA will replenish their strength from their inner hive reserves. We do not have an estimate on their reserve size. There's also a chance of an unexpected BETA offensive if our estimates are wrong.§!"
