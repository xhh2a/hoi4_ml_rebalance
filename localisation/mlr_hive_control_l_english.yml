 mlr_hive_growth_prediction:0 "Growing Hive"
 mlr_hive_growth_prediction_desc:0 "Unless humanity gains a foothold in the hive, this hive is predicted to grow to the next stage when this idea expires. The hive has grown [?mlr_hive_growth|O0]/[?mlr_hive_control_calculated_growth_threshold|C0] needed to advance to the next stage. This will change by [?mlr_hive_growth_rate|-0] every §W30§! days.\nHives cannot grow larger than the main hive. However they will not decrease in size if the main hive is"
 mlr_hive_shrink_prediction:0 "Collapsing Hive"
 mlr_hive_shrink_prediction_desc:0 "The BETA Hive will slowly cease activity as long as the BETA do not control the core."

 mlr_hive_control_recovering_hive:0 "This BETA Hive has recaptured the main stab. They will rapidly regain strength each month unless countermeasures are taken."
 mlr_hive_control_culling_operation:0 "Launch Culling Operation Against [From.Owner.GetName]"
 mlr_hive_control_culling_operation_desc:0 "Large-scale BETA invasions occur when BETA 'groups' that dot the hive's surroundings are pushed out by new BETA emerging from the hive. Since the mid-90's, where this 'Hive Saturation' model was recognized, combat has focused on actively attacking the BETA to adjust their numbers, in order to prevent the propagation of hives. Often, the goal of the operation is to defeat a group of BETA roughly on the scale of a brigade or division, though depending on the progress of the operation, this can span over a few days. The frequency with which culling is conducted depends on the scale of the hive. At Phase 2, they can adequately be conducted five months apart, and by Phase 4, they can be conducted three months apart. However, these periodic, limited offensives have ended up as a large burden on humanity.\n§WWhile a culling operation is active, the BETA hive will grow at a slower rate. In addition, the BETA will be less able to launch offensives."
 mlr_hive_control_culling_operation_idea:0 "Coordinated Culling Operation"
 mlr_hive_control_culling_operation_idea_desc:0 "A coordinated effort by mankind has been launched to thin the visible BETA population. This will reduce hive growth by §G15§! per §W30§! days, and reduce horde growth by §G50§!k."
